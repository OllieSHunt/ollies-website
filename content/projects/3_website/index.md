# This Website

## Why?
This website's main reason for existing is that I felt like making a website. It also serves as a good place to talk about and share my thoughts as well as to showcase what I can do to any potential future employers.

## SSI and Zola
I originally used [SSI (Server Side Includes)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Includes) to make reusable components that could be shared between pages such as the navigation bar, but eventually decided to switch to using the static site generator [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and its excellent templating engine, [Tera](https://keats.github.io/tera/).

For more information on this, see [this blog post](/blog/reinventing-the-ssg).
