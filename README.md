# Ollie's Website
This is the source code for my personal website.

## Credits
All articles are written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and then converted automatically to HTML using the static site generator [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/).

The icons are from a set called [Tabler](https://github.com/tabler/tabler-icons) which I originally found on the website [Iconify](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/tabler/).

The colour theme is based off [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox).
